"There are two ways of running saned:\n"
" - as an inetd service, started by the inetd superserver. In this mode,\n"
"saned is started on demand when a client connects to the server;\n"
" - as a standalone daemon, started at system boot. In this mode, saned\n"
"runs in the background all by itself and listens for client connections."

"When run in standalone mode, saned advertises itself on the network and can "
"be detected automatically by the SANE clients with no configuration on the "
"client side. You still need to configure the server to accept connections "
"from your clients. This feature is experimental and requires a running Avahi "
"daemon."
