  * Merge from Debian testing, remaining changes:
    - debian/patches/disable_v4l.patch: Disable v4l backend.
    - debian/patches/fix_avahi_error_paths.patch: fix free order of
      avahi_client and avahi_browser in failure path, fixing assert when
      avahi is unavailable
    - debian/control:
      + Demote libsane-extras* from Recommends to Suggests, as long as
        this package is in universe.
      + Demote sane-utils from Recommends to Suggests.
        We do not want to have an init script for saned laying around,
        which is disabled by default anyway.
      + Drop the alternative "makedev" dependency; we only support udev.
    - debian/libsane.postinst: Don't create a scanner group.
    - debian/rules:
      + Link using -Bsymbolic-functions (startup time optimization).
      + Saned init script does not need to be started before gdm
        and does not need to be called on shutdown.
    - debian/sane-utils.*: No longer have scanner group.
    - debian/sane-utils.saned.init: Saned init script does not need to
      be started before gdm and does not need to be called on shutdown.
  * Dropped changes, no longer needed:
    - debian/libsane.preinst:
      + Remove the old file if unmodified.
      + Remove the old blacklist-scanner modprobe file.
    - Dropped "acl" dependency: acl is part of the standard system and
      the udev rules still reference setfacl, so we should keep this
      dependency here.

  * Merge from Debian testing, remaining changes:
    - Add 42_add_epson_cx_6000.dpatch: Add Epson CX6000. (LP: #314485)
    - Add 43_scanadf_error_check.dpatch: Backport from Debian's
      sane-backends git repo adding additional error checking.
      (LP: #469540)
    - Add 44_add_epson_mfp_devs.dpatch: Add additional device id.
      (LP: #469540)
    - Don't apply 11_udev_147, because ubuntu_udev_noperm.dpatch is
      more appropriate for Ubuntu:
      + Do not change device permissions (already covered by udev-extra's
        70-acl.rules)
      + Do not cover SCSI scanners (already covered by udev-extra's
        70-acl.rules)
      + Simplify description and structure.
    - debian/control:
      + Demote libsane-extras from Depends: to Suggests:, as long as
        this package is in universe.
      + Demote sane-utils and avahi-daemon from Recommends to Suggests.
        We do not want to have an init script for saned laying around,
        which is disabled by default anyway.
    - debian/libsane.dirs.linux: remove
    - debian/{libsane.install.in,libsane-dev.install,rules}: Install
      documentation into libsane-dev instead of libsane to save CD space.
    - debian/rules:
      + Link using -Bsymbolic-functions (startup time optimization).
      + /etc/modprobe.d/libsane blacklists two modules that don't exist
        anymore, dropped creation of this file
    - debian{rules,sane-utils.saned.init}: saned init script does not need
      to be started before gdm, and does not need to be called on shutdown.
    - debian/libsane.postinst: Do not create the scanner group.
    - debian/{sane-utils.config,sane-utils.postinst,sane-utils.templates}:
      Drop the support for saned in the scanner group, since we don't have
      a scanner group anymore!
    - debian/libsane.preinst:
      + Remove the old blacklist-scanner modprobe file.  LP: #340873.
      + Remove the old file if unmodified
    - debian/rules: Install udev rules again, since we now don't rely on
      hal any more and thus we need the ENV{libsane_matched}=="yes" flag.

sane-backends (1.0.19~cvs20070505-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/30_sanei_scsi_sg_ioctl.dpatch:
    + Added; use the SG_IO ioctl interface instead of the asynchronous

      layer taking care of the 32/64bit sg_hdr conversion (closes: #420193).

    If you own a SCSI scanner, please report back on this change; especially
    if, compared to the previous version (1.0.19~cvs20070505-2):
     - the scanner backtracks more than it used to with the previous version
     - you see weird errors OR you see no error and you should be seeing some
     - performance sucks
     - resulting image is broken in one way or another
     - ...

    * Converted to dpatch. Build-depends on dpatch.
    * Re-enable the gphoto2 backend, -but- do so that frontends do not get linked
      against libgphoto2. Only the backend is linked against it. (closes: #195613)

    * Effectively move the html doc to the html subdir, instead of copying them
      with dh_install.
